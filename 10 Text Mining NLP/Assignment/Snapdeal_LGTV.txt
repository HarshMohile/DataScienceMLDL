	                        The LG TV delivered to me is manufactured in 2014.
When I place the order on 13th June 2016 I expect a 2016 manufacturerd TV and not an outdated TV.
The year of manufacturing was not mentioned in the product description before purchase. Very unhappy...

	                        The product is living upto the expectations even after 1 week,  LED picture quality is good. However the sound quality is 10w whereas my 5year old LCD has got 200w  price being the same around that time, so, this makes one drawback. MHL support is good. No lg demo serive was given as they told me that demo service ia only if u have purchased it from showroom.

	                        The product is very good but the service from snapdeal is worst, they have the worst delivery time, the product  delivery was delayed very badly and it almost took 20 days for them to deliver the product. The customer service agent is always clueless as to what is happening with the product.

	                        The product is really good. This is the first product i bought from snapdeal. First i had gone to a nearby store and liked this product but the picture quality compared to samsung and sony was bit low and was within my budget. But nw when i view it's really good i think in stores they reduce the brightness of the products with low price and increase the brightness of high range products.
 
There was no wall mount inside the box so i contacted the customer care and they said it will be done by LG services. So i contacted them and within 1 hr they came and installed the wall mount free of cost.
